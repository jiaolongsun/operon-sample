	<h2>Tutorial</h2>
	<p>For our database we have used RNA-seq datasets for 9 organisms and predicted operons using Rockhopper. It shows different organisms user can select from the drop-down list and it will display the screen for that particular bacterial genome. It shows, there are three options available for users, as they can view the table of operons predicted, download the table for operons and view operons using jBrowse. If you click on the option with view in jBrowse it will take the user to jBrowse using that user can view reference sequence, gene list for the particular bacterial genome and operon list predicted. User can also select the operon data for different conditions from which RNA-seq datasets have been taken on the basis of their SRA ids. Using SRA id user can look for the particular condition of each bacterial genome in SRA database from NCBI.</p>
	<p>Now from the jBrowse, if the user have selected any particular operon, it will provide the information regarding the position of that particular operon, itâ€™s length in bp and its attributes such as Id, names of the genes associated, sequence id, source and region sequence in FASTA format. And if the user select any gene, it will provide the information regarding the primary data which is name of gene, position, length and for the other attributes it will provide the information regarding Dbxref, Gbkey, id of gene, locus, Seq_id, source and the region sequence for that particular gene in FASTA format. The interface was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
